Win32 Output Folder
-------------------

This folder is the primary output folder for MinGW/MSYS development.

Files that should be present and not be deleted, for source
distributions:
* README
* Makefile
* luasdl.rc - resource file
* luasdl.ico - icon file
* __init__.lua - script that will be automatically executed
* minifont.lua - mini message display library
* minipath.lua - mini path processing library

For binary distributions, do not delete the DLL libraries unless the
library is one that is loaded on demand and you know you won't be using
them.

"make clean" mostly cleans up this folder.
