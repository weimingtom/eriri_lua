Notes on DejaVu-Sans-Mono-13.{xcf|bmp}
--------------------------------------

This is a primitive bitmap font to display helpful messages on LuaSDL,
avoiding the need for non-expert users to look for stdout.txt and
stderr.txt. Thus, if LuaSDL works, but there is a problem with the
program script, a message can be displayed.

Created using The GIMP, using 13 point DejaVu Sans Mono. The result on
GIMP is a font with a 8x14 box. As the simple font cannot have pixels
jutting out of the main box, some glyphs have been adjusted. Also, some
glyphs cannot be rendered adjacent to each other due to aliasing.
Background colour is black, foreground colour is yellow. Hinting and
aliasing on.

First saved as XCF, then as a 24-bit BMP. 24-bit BMP is indexed to 255
colours, then saved as a BMP with RLE. In order to get the dialog with
RLE, use "Save as".
